title: Prospective Case Studies
---

These case study candidates were identified by Cornell Tech students enrolled in a Spring 2023 course, "Smart Cities: Requirements, Ambitions, and Limitations", taught by Dr. Anthony Townsend. This course examined the concept of “smart cities” as a sociotechnical movement that seeks to expand the use of digital technologies in urban development, service delivery, and governance.

These case studies are propsective starting points for future student work. We also welcome contributions from anyone. [Instructions](https://github.com/Cornell-Tech-Urban-Tech-Hub/atlas-of-urban-tech/) on how to prepare and submit a contributed case study are provided in the [Atlas content repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Cornell-Tech-Urban-Tech-Hub/atlas-of-urban-tech/).
