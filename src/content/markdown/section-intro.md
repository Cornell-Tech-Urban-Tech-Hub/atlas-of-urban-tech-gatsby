The Atlas of Urban Tech collects case studies created by Cornell Tech students analyzing how city governments and city makers are using digital technology to make cities stronger, fairer, and more resilient. You'll find two types of case studies here:

<div class="case-types">
<div class="type-plan"><p>
<strong>Digital masterplans</strong> are comprehensive, long-range plans adopted by municipalities to guide policy, planning, and investment in smart city and urban tech solutions. These cases help us understand the technology priorities, strategies, and interventions of city governments.
</p></div>
<div>
<div class="type-district"><p>
<strong>Tech-enabled districts</strong>  are neighborhood-scale real estate development projects that combine buildings, utilities, and digital services to create value for tenants, residents, and visitors. These cases help us understand the opportunities, risks, and rewards facing private sector investors.
